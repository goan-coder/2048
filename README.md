# Quick Self-playing Demo

This game was tested and works on Java 1.8+.
When in the root directory of this project:

1. Change directory to `bin`
2. Run on the terminal: `java Frame1`
3. A window will pop up.
4. Ensure that the game mode is `Simulation` and the board size is `4`. The target can be ignored(the game will reach a sum of tiles of 8, backtrack if necessary).
5. The simulation will play out on the GUI as well as print to stdout. The moves are made at a 2 second time gap for easy viewing.
6. The window can be closed when simulation is done.
